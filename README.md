# üè† Physics-Guided Grey-Box Modeling for Building Thermal Performance

This repository presents a Python-based implementation of **RC thermal network modeling** for building envelope simulation, integrated with **data-driven optimization (PSO)** and **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. The code is validated using experimental sensor data from ASU‚Äôs ULA building.

## üìà Roof Zone Performance ‚Äì Error Evolution

This section highlights the improvement in roof zone accuracy from the initial black-box baseline to the final Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-corrected predictions.

Each plot shows **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** split by **daytime** and **nighttime** periods for the **roof temperature only**.
